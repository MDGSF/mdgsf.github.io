Dep is a tool for managing dependencies for Go projects

Usage: "dep [command]"

Commands:

  init     Set up a new Go project, or migrate an existing one
  status   Report the status of the project's dependencies
  ensure   Ensure a dependency is safely vendored in the project
  prune    Pruning is now performed automatically by dep ensure.
  version  Show the dep version information

Examples:
  dep init                               set up a new project
  dep ensure                             install the project's dependencies
  dep ensure -update                     update the locked versions of all dependencies
  dep ensure -add github.com/pkg/errors  add a dependency to the project

Use "dep help [command]" for more information about a command.
```


```
root@jian-VirtualBox:~/git/zhonghangxun# dep help ensure
Usage: dep ensure [-update | -add] [-no-vendor | -vendor-only] [-dry-run] [-v] [<spec>...]

Project spec:

  <import path>[:alt source URL][@<constraint>]


Ensure gets a project into a complete, reproducible, and likely compilable state:

  * All non-stdlib imports are fulfilled
  * All rules in Gopkg.toml are respected
  * Gopkg.lock records precise versions for all dependencies
  * vendor/ is populated according to Gopkg.lock

Ensure has fast techniques to determine that some of these steps may be
unnecessary. If that determination is made, ensure may skip some steps. Flags
may be passed to bypass these checks; -vendor-only will allow an out-of-date
Gopkg.lock to populate vendor/, and -no-vendor will update Gopkg.lock (if
needed), but never touch vendor/.

The effect of passing project spec arguments varies slightly depending on the
combination of flags that are passed.


Examples:

  dep ensure                                 Populate vendor from existing Gopkg.toml and Gopkg.lock
  dep ensure -add github.com/pkg/foo         Introduce a named dependency at its newest version
  dep ensure -add github.com/pkg/foo@^1.0.1  Introduce a named dependency with a particular constraint

For more detailed usage examples, see dep ensure -examples.

Flags:

  -add          add new dependencies, or populate Gopkg.toml with constraints for existing dependencies (default: false)
  -dry-run      only report the changes that would be made (default: false)
  -examples     print detailed usage examples (default: false)
  -no-vendor    update Gopkg.lock (if needed), but do not update vendor/ (default: false)
  -update       update the named dependencies (or all, if none are named) in Gopkg.lock to the latest allowed by Gopkg.toml (default: false)
  -v            enable verbose logging (default: false)
  -vendor-only  populate vendor/ from Gopkg.lock without updating it first (default: false)

```



```

dep ensure

    Solve the project's dependency graph, and place all dependencies in the
    vendor folder. If a dependency is in the lock file, use the version
    specified there. Otherwise, use the most recent version that can satisfy the
    constraints in the manifest file.

dep ensure -vendor-only

    Write vendor/ from an existing Gopkg.lock file, without first verifying that
    the lock is in sync with imports and Gopkg.toml. (This may be useful for
    e.g. strategically layering a Docker images)

dep ensure -add github.com/pkg/foo github.com/pkg/foo/bar

    Introduce one or more dependencies, at their newest version, ensuring that
    specific packages are present in Gopkg.lock and vendor/. Also, append a
    corresponding constraint to Gopkg.toml.

    Note: packages introduced in this way will disappear on the next "dep
    ensure" if an import statement is not added first.

dep ensure -add github.com/pkg/foo/subpkg@1.0.0 bitbucket.org/pkg/bar/baz@master

    Append version constraints to Gopkg.toml for one or more packages, if no
    such rules already exist.

    If the named packages are not already imported, also ensure they are present
    in Gopkg.lock and vendor/. As in the preceding example, packages introduced
    in this way will disappear on the next "dep ensure" if an import statement
    is not added first.

dep ensure -add github.com/pkg/foo:git.internal.com/alt/foo

    Specify an alternate location to treat as the upstream source for a dependency.

dep ensure -update github.com/pkg/foo github.com/pkg/bar

    Update a list of dependencies to the latest versions allowed by Gopkg.toml,
    ignoring any versions recorded in Gopkg.lock. Write the results to
    Gopkg.lock and vendor/.

dep ensure -update

    Update all dependencies to the latest versions allowed by Gopkg.toml,
    ignoring any versions recorded in Gopkg.lock. Update the lock file with any
    changes. (NOTE: Not recommended. Updating one/some dependencies at a time is
    preferred.)

dep ensure -update -no-vendor

    As above, but only modify Gopkg.lock; leave vendor/ unchanged.

dep ensure -no-vendor -dry-run

    This fails with a non zero exit code if Gopkg.lock is not up to date with
    the Gopkg.toml or the project imports. It can be useful to run this during
    CI to check if Gopkg.lock is up to date.
