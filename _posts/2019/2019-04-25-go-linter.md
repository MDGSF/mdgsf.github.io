```bash
$ golangci-lint -h
Smart, fast linters runner. Run it in cloud for every GitHub pull request on https://golangci.com

Usage:
  golangci-lint [flags]
  golangci-lint [command]

Available Commands:
  config      Config
  help        Help
  linters     List current linters configuration
  run         Run this tool in cloud on every github pull request in https://golangci.com for free (public repos)

Flags:
      --color string              Use color when printing; can be 'always', 'auto', or 'never' (default "auto")
  -j, --concurrency int           Concurrency (default NumCPU) (default 8)
      --cpu-profile-path string   Path to CPU profile output file
  -h, --help                      help for golangci-lint
      --mem-profile-path string   Path to memory profile output file
  -v, --verbose                   verbose output
      --version                   Print version

Use "golangci-lint [command] --help" for more information about a command.

```bash
$ golangci-lint linters
Enabled by your configuration linters:
deadcode: Finds unused code [fast: true, auto-fix: false]
errcheck: Errcheck is a program for checking for unchecked errors in go programs. These unchecked errors can be critical bugs in some cases [fast: true, auto-fix: false]
gosimple: Linter for Go source code that specializes in simplifying a code [fast: false, auto-fix: false]
govet (vet, vetshadow): Vet examines Go source code and reports suspicious constructs, such as Printf calls whose arguments do not align with the format string [fast: false, auto-fix: false]
ineffassign: Detects when assignments to existing variables are not used [fast: true, auto-fix: false]
staticcheck: Staticcheck is a go vet on steroids, applying a ton of static analysis checks [fast: false, auto-fix: false]
structcheck: Finds an unused struct fields [fast: true, auto-fix: false]
typecheck: Like the front-end of a Go compiler, parses and type-checks Go code [fast: true, auto-fix: false]
unused: Checks Go code for unused constants, variables, functions and types [fast: false, auto-fix: false]
varcheck: Finds unused global variables and constants [fast: true, auto-fix: false]

Disabled by your configuration linters:
depguard: Go linter that checks if package imports are in a list of acceptable packages [fast: true, auto-fix: false]
dupl: Tool for code clone detection [fast: true, auto-fix: false]
gochecknoglobals: Checks that no globals are present in Go code [fast: true, auto-fix: false]
gochecknoinits: Checks that no init functions are present in Go code [fast: true, auto-fix: false]
goconst: Finds repeated strings that could be replaced by a constant [fast: true, auto-fix: false]
gocritic: The most opinionated Go source code linter [fast: true, auto-fix: false]
gocyclo: Computes and checks the cyclomatic complexity of functions [fast: true, auto-fix: false]
gofmt: Gofmt checks whether code was gofmt-ed. By default this tool runs with -s option to check for code simplification [fast: true, auto-fix: true]
goimports: Goimports does everything that gofmt does. Additionally it checks unused imports [fast: true, auto-fix: true]
golint: Golint differs from gofmt. Gofmt reformats Go source code, whereas golint prints out style mistakes [fast: true, auto-fix: false]
gosec (gas): Inspects source code for security problems [fast: true, auto-fix: false]
interfacer: Linter that suggests narrower interface types [fast: false, auto-fix: false]
lll: Reports long lines [fast: true, auto-fix: false]
maligned: Tool to detect Go structs that would take less memory if their fields were sorted [fast: true, auto-fix: false]
misspell: Finds commonly misspelled English words in comments [fast: true, auto-fix: true]
nakedret: Finds naked returns in functions greater than a specified function length [fast: true, auto-fix: false]
prealloc: Finds slice declarations that could potentially be preallocated [fast: true, auto-fix: false]
scopelint: Scopelint checks for unpinned variables in go programs [fast: true, auto-fix: false]
stylecheck: Stylecheck is a replacement for golint [fast: false, auto-fix: false]
unconvert: Remove unnecessary type conversions [fast: true, auto-fix: false]
unparam: Reports unused function parameters [fast: false, auto-fix: false]
