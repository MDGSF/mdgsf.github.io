## lua 数据类型

There are eight basic types in Lua: nil, Boolean, number, string, userdata, function, thread, and table.

```
> type(nil) --> nil
> type(true) --> boolean
> type(10.4 * 3) --> number
> type("Hello world") --> string
> type(io.stdin) --> userdata
> type(print) --> function
> type(type) --> function
> type({}) --> table
> type(type(X)) --> string
```

## Booleans

Conditional tests consider both the Boolean false and nil
as false and anything else as true. In particular, Lua considers both zero and the empty string as true in
conditional tests.

### and, or, not 操作符

The result of the **and** operator is its first operand if that operand is false; otherwise, the result is its second operand.

The result of the **or** operator is its first operand if it is not false; otherwise, the result is its second operand

```
> 4 and 5 --> 5
> nil and 13 --> nil
> false and 13 --> false
> 0 or 5 --> 0
> false or "hi" --> "hi"
> nil or false --> false
```

The **not** operator always gives a Boolean value:

```
> not nil --> true
> not false --> true
> not 0 --> false
> not not 1 --> true
> not not nil --> false
```

A useful Lua idiom is x = x or v, which is equivalent to (if not x then x = v end).

Another useful idiom is ((a and b) or c) or simply (a and b or c) (given that and has a
higher precedence than or). It is equivalent to the C expression a ? b : c.
