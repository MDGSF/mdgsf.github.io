## Problem

Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous two terms. By starting with 1 and 2, the first 10 terms will be:

1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, ...

By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed four million, find the sum of the even-valued terms.


## Answer

4613732


## Code

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
	a := 1
	b := 2
	c := 0
	sum := 2
	for a < 4000000 {
		c = a + b
		a = b
		b = c
		if c%2 == 0 {
			sum += c
		}
	}
	fmt.Println(sum)
}
```
