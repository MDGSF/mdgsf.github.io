## 题目

You are a product manager and currently leading a team to develop a new product. Unfortunately, the latest version of your product fails the quality check. Since each version is developed based on the previous version, all the versions after a bad version are also bad.

Suppose you have `n` versions `[1, 2, ..., n]` and you want to find out the first bad one, which causes all the following ones to be bad.

You are given an API `bool isBadVersion(version)` which will return whether `version` is bad. Implement a function to find the first bad version. You should minimize the number of calls to the API.

## 参考答案

```c++
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

// Forward declaration of isBadVersion API.
bool isBadVersion(int version);

class Solution {
public:
    int firstBadVersion(int n)
    {
        int iFirstBad = 0;

        int iStart = 1;
        int iEnd = n;
        while (iStart <= iEnd)
        {
            int iMid = iStart + (iEnd - iStart) / 2;
            if (isBadVersion(iMid))
            {
                iEnd = iMid - 1;
                iFirstBad = iMid;
            }
            else
            {
                iStart = iMid + 1;
            }
        }
        return iFirstBad;
    }
};

int main()
{
    return 0;
}
```
