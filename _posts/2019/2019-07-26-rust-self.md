`self` when used as first method argument, is a shorthand for `self: Self`. There are also `&self`, which is equivalent to `self: &Self`, and `&mut self`, which is equivalent to `self: &mut self`.

`Self` in method arguments is syntactic sugar for the receiving type of the method (i.e. the type whose `impl` this method is in). This also allows for generic types without too much repetition.
